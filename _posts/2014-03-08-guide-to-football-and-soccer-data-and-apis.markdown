##  Where can I actually find football/soccer data?

There are three main ways to get data. You can parse/scrape it from a hobbyist project/website, you can pay for it or you can try to collect it yourself.

###  Open Source Data on Github

<a name="openfootball"></a>
#### openfootball - aka football.db

**[openfootball (aka football.db)](http://openfootball.github.io/)** has started a free, open source public domain football database.
The data is historical data, meaning no lives scores but the data does include the schedule, teams and players for the 2014 World Cup along with global league data. This is a very promising project and has the **potential to be the definitive source for historical data for the public**.
See the [opensport Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opensport) for discussion and questions. The data is stored in various repos on github.
Consider contributing any data you have yourself and be sure to thank [Gerald Bauer](https://github.com/geraldb). All the various repos can be intimidating. A good place to start is at [github.com/openfootball](https://github.com/openfootball/).

An example of the plain text (custom format):

    [Sat Aug/16]
      12.45  Manchester United    1-2  Swansea City
      15.00  Leicester City       2-2  Everton FC
      15.00  Queens Park Rangers  0-1  Hull City
      15.00  Stoke City           0-1  Aston Villa


Check out the following github organizations for more listings:

 - <https://github.com/footballcsv>
 - <https://github.com/openfootball>
 - <https://github.com/rsssf>
 - <https://github.com/footballdata>

There is also an open source football.db HTTP JSON(P) [API](http://openfootball.github.io/docs/json-api-intro.html) for demo purposes. Example Endpoints:

    http://footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/world.2014/teams
    http://footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/world.2014/round/1

###  Free APIs

<a name="footballdata"></a>
#### football-data.org (beta)

[football-data.org](http://www.football-data.org/) is a RESTful API in beta with regularly updated data. If you [register for a free API key](http://www.football-data.org/register) you will get CORS support. I recommend registering for a key to show your support and help the service track usage. However, a key is not required yet so you can try out the endpoints right now. I am excited to see this API grow and mature!

Available endpoints

    /soccerseasons/
    /soccerseasons/{id}/ranking
    /soccerseasons/{id}/fixtures
    /fixtures
    /soccerseasons/{id}/teams
    /teams/{id}
    /teams/{id}/fixtures/

Some example calls:

- <http://api.football-data.org/v1/soccerseasons>
- <http://api.football-data.org/v1/soccerseasons/351/teams>
- <http://api.football-data.org/v1/fixtures>
- <http://api.football-data.org/v1/teams/5>
- <http://api.football-data.org/v1/soccerseasons/424> (European Championships France 2016)

<a name="openfooty"></a>
#### openfooty API

[openfooty API](http://www.footytube.com/openfooty/) had promising API documentation but a quick look at the developer forums shows a stale community and questions about why no one seems to actually be able to get a developer key.

#### Betlines Ninja API (betting/odds)

The free [API](https://market.mashape.com/arisalexis/soccer-odds) (hosted on Mashape) is for betting odds but contains a lot of upcoming fixture data.

The demo (EPL) free feature is no longer available. Here is part of the [email notice](http://football-api.com/?na=v&id=2&nk=276-ef27b4e6d5) sent:

> Discontinuation Of The Demo Plan (March 3 2016)
>
>  In the last couple of weekends, we experienced a very high load on our servers. This lead to delayed responses and very slow data return. We had to take emergency measures and unfortunately, we had to suspend the demo access to the English Premier League in favour of our paying customers. This decision is hard for us since we would like to offer this demo access for free. However, with around 3000 demo users, the load on our servers was too high.

> Since the demo plan was not planned for production purposes (hence the name), we apologize if we have disturbed your development and surprised you with a lot of error messages.


<i>This is why we can't have nice things.</i>

### SPAPI

[SPAPI](https://spapi.pw?code=jokecamp) offers subscriptions for a RESTful Sports API including live scores, player statistics, betting odds, pre-game data and match event data. The data response look pretty comprehensive.

Pricing:

    Starter Plan is $299 per month
    Growth pla is $499 per month
    Pro Plan is $899 per month

Look at the example of one of the action data objects. It looks like data for a defensive clearance including x,y coordinates.

    {
        "minute": 53,
        "second": 10,
        "team_id": 32,
        "start_x": 20.8,
        "start_y": 69.5,
        "expanded_minute": 57,
        "period": {
          "name": "SecondHalf",
          "value": 2
        },
        "type": {
          "name": "Clearance",
          "value": 12
        },
        "outcome_type": {
          "name": "Successful",
          "value": 1
        },

          "value": "Back"
        }],
        "is_touch": true
      }

Example endpoints:

    https://spapi.pw/api/v1/competitions/5/upcoming_matches
    https://spapi.pw/api/v1/competitions/5/finished_matches
    https://spapi.pw/api/v1/competitions/5/standings?standing_type=standings

    https://spapi.pw/api/v1/livescores
    https://spapi.pw/api/v1/players/1/statistics

Pretty impressive but this level of detail comes at a price. Authentication method is a API key in querystring.

<a name="sportmonks"></a>
####Sportmonks.com

[https://sportmonks.com](https://sportmonks.com) offers a JSON API. There are plans with prices ranging between 15 to 200 euro's per month. There is also an option for custom plans. This API support lazy loading, meaning you pass parameters in your request to load relationships and nested relationships.

Registration to this API is free and every plan has a 14 day trial.

Some example endpoints are:

    https://soccer.sportmonks.com/api/v2.0/livescores?api_token=__YOURTOKEN__
    https://soccer.sportmonks.com/api/v2.0/leagues?api_token=__YOURTOKEN__

    https://soccer.sportmonks.com/api/v2.0/fixtures/{id}?api_token=__YOURTOKEN__&include=localTeam,visitorTeam,events

And an example response looks like:

```json

#### Resultados de Fútbol API

[Resultados-futbol.com](http://www.resultados-futbol.com/api) is a spanish football website with live scores and historical data with a database of more than four million matches and hundreds of competitions all around the world. When they decided to make their own mobile apps they created an API to serve both the apps and the website and made it available to developers.

Their API covers a lot from live scores with events to player stats, transfers, betting odds, etc. Chances are that if you find some info on the website it will be available on the API also. It is well documented in spanish only.

Their prices range from 99€ per year for around 1,000 requests per day to 499€ per month for 100k request per day. They offer a one month free trial with full access to the API and 500 request per day. Authentication method is a API key in the querystring.

<a name="opta"></a>
#### opta

[opta](http://www.optasports.com) is one of industry leaders. This is what the tv networks use and likely what the actual football clubs use for [scouting](http://www.optasportspro.com/products/scouting-reports-and-data-feeds.aspx). If only this data were public! Opta used to provide a developer program under the title "Opta Playground" but it seems that the [site](http://www.optasports.com/playground-section.aspx) has been removed and now shows a 404 error. The site used to read "Opta can provide data for programmers wishing to develop a mobile app or website with selected historical data available to download." You had to request permission in an email. I applied and they sent me the xml data set for 10 rounds of games from the start of the 2007/2008 Bundesliga 2. The more detailed game data had either x,y coordinates of game events. A very impressive dataset but it felt more like an advertisement. The data provided I had no interest in and I'm not sure why an indie developer would spend time working on a data set they could never afford. They even track this data point "Spectator on pitch." Read this article [FiveThirtyEight behind the scenes look at how opta tracks data](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-people-tracking-every-touch-pass-and-tackle-in-the-world-cup/) (spoiler: young male gamers).

<a name="wiki"></a>
#### Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) - has a lot of structured data and is also crowd/public sourced. You can use their API to query then parse the data. It is very fragmented into specific pages making this a good source if you are looking for very specific team/player data. For example here is a table of Manchester United season results <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Manchester_United_F.C._seasons>.

[2014 World Cup JSON API - Soccer for Good](http://softwareforgood.com/soccer-good/) - The API is available now. The author explains that the data is from a scraper so the availability is not guaranteed but should be available throughout the tournament. There are endpoints for [teams](http://worldcup.sfg.io/teams), [matches](http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches), [today](http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches/today), [tomorrow](http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches/tomorrow) and [current](http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches/current). The Ruby on Rails source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/estiens/world_cup_json)

[World Cup in JSON](http://worldcup.sfg.io/) - an open source ruby project available at [github.com/estiens/world_cup_json](https://github.com/estiens/world_cup_json) that scrapes a few sources and combines into an API. API is available at http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches

[Unofficial FIFA.com JSON API for Mobile Apps](http://live.mobileapp.fifa.com/api/wc/matches)  This is unofficial and I wouldn't be surprised if it is protected/unavailable soon. Until then its nice to see data straight from the source. Known endpoints: [matches](http://live.mobileapp.fifa.com/api/wc/matches), [teams](http://live.mobileapp.fifa.com/api/wc/teams) or detailed [match info](http://live.mobileapp.fifa.com/api/wc/match/300186492/en)

<a name="api-graveyard"></a>
###  Deprecated/Retired - "The Graveyard of APIs"

[ESPN API](http://developer.espn.com/docs) has an API for registered users (free). You can get a list of all the players in the EPL. However they are very limited in their data. They restrict all fixtures and scores to "strategic partners." However, you can get lists of players and teams. The **Public API is being retired on Monday, December 8, 2014** [Read the announcement](http://developer.espn.com/blog/read/publicretirement)

[StatsFC](https://statsfc.com/) used to have an restful JSON API of all EPL scores and fixtures. It was about $8 us dollars a month but was recently shut down. See their [official statement](https://statsfc.com/statement). They still offer widgets and they plan on reviving their servies. See their comments at the bottom of the page.
